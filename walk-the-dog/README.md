## Refactoring for endless running

### A more useful Rect

The `Rect` implementation only contains the intersects method, 
but there are two very useful methods it could use: `right` and `bottom`. 
If you look at the method we just wrote on Image, 
you will see that it's a natural fit for a `right` function. 

Let's go ahead and add it to Rect :


```rust
// src/engine.rs

/*
impl Rect {
    pub fn intersects(&self, rect: &Rect) -> bool {
        self.x < (rect.x + rect.width)
        && self.x + self.width > rect.x
        && self.y < (rect.y + rect.height)
        && self.y + self.height > rect.y
    }
}
*/

impl Rect {
    pub fn intersects(&self, rect: &Rect) -> bool {
        self.x < rect.right()
        && self.right() > rect.x
        && self.y < rect.bottom()
        && self.bottom() > rect.y
    }
    pub fn right(&self) -> i16 {
        self.x + self.width
    }
    pub fn bottom(&self) -> i16 {
        self.y + self.height
    }
}//^-- impl Rect

```
Adding the `right` and `bottom` methods will prevent that addition logic from getting
smeared across the game logic. We've also refactored intersects to use these new methods. 

Now, let's go back to the `Image` code we just wrote and update it to use the new `right` method, 
as shown here:



```rust
// src/engine.rs

impl Image {
    ...
    /*
    pub fn right(&self) -> i16 {
        (self.bounding_box.x + self.bounding_box.width) as i16
    }
    */

    pub fn right(&self) -> i16 {
        self.bounding_box.right()
    }
}
```

While we're in `Image`, let's deal with the duplication of `position` and `bounding_box`.

### Setting Rect's position

An image containing a `bounding_box` **Rect** and a `position` **Point** is an accident 
that occurred due to our code evolving. So, the question is, which one do we want to keep?

We could always keep `bounding_box` for the image, which would mean constructing a Point 
every time we draw because we need that for the `draw_entire_element` call.

We could also create a `Dimens` structure that just has `width` and `height`, 
and construct a `Rect` every time we need it on the update. 

While I doubt that the cost of creating those objects is going to be noticeable, 
the fact that it's on every frame is bothersome.

What we'll do instead is give `Rect` a `position` field â€“ after all, 
that's what the `x` and `y` coordinates of `Rect` are. 
This is a seemingly minor change but with far-reaching implications 
because we constantly initialize `Rect` with `x` and `y`. 

Fortunately, we can use the compiler to make this simpler for us. 
We'll start by changing `Rect` to hold a `position` field, instead of `x` and `y`:



```rust
// src/engine.rs

/*
pub struct Rect {
    pub x: i16,
    pub y: i16,
    pub width: i16,
    pub height: i16,
}
*/

pub struct Rect {
    pub position: Point,
    pub width: i16,
    pub height: i16,
}

```
Adding `position` is going to cause compiler errors all over the place, as expected. 

We know that we frequently want to both access the `x` and `y` values 
and create a `Rect` using `x` and `y`, so to make it easier to work with, 
we'll add two **factory** methods for `Rect`, as shown here:


```rust
// src/engine.rs

impl Rect {
    pub fn new(position: Point, width: i16, height: i16) -> Self {
        Rect {
            position,
            width,
            height,
        }
    }

    pub fn new_from_x_y(x: i16, y: i16, width: i16, height: i16) -> Self {
        Rect::new(Point { x, y }, width, height)
    }

    pub fn intersects(&self, rect: &Rect) -> bool {
    ...
...

```

Now, when we fix Rect everywhere, we will stop creating a Rect directly and instead use
the new constructor methods. We'll also add getters for x and y because we access those
frequently, as shown here:

```rust
// src/engine.rs

impl Rect {
    ...
    pub fn x(&self) -> i16 {
        self.position.x
    }
    pub fn y(&self) -> i16 {
        self.position.y
    }

```
This gives you most of the tools you will need to fix the compiler errors. 
I won't reproduce all of them, because there are quite a few and it's repetitive. 

There are two examples you can use to make take care of all but one error. 
The first is replacing every reference to `.x` or `.y` with references to the methods.

This is how you do that in the intersects method of Rect :

```rust
// src/engine.rs

/*
    pub fn intersects(&self, rect: &Rect) -> bool {
        self.x < rect.right()
        && self.right() > rect.x
        && self.y < rect.bottom()
        && self.bottom() > rect.y
    }
*/
    pub fn intersects(&self, rect: &Rect) -> bool {
        self.x() < rect.right()
        && self.right() > rect.x()
        && self.y() < rect.bottom()
        && self.bottom() > rect.y()
    }
```

use the compiler and keep replacing 

```rust
// src/engine.rs

/*
    pub fn right(&self) -> i16 {
        self.x + self.width
    }
    pub fn bottom(&self) -> i16 {
        self.y + self.height
    }
*/
    pub fn right(&self) -> i16 {
        self.x() + self.width
    }
    pub fn bottom(&self) -> i16 {
        self.y() + self.height
    }
```

```rust
// src/engine.rs

impl Image {
    pub fn new(element: HtmlImageElement, position: Point) -> Self {
        let bounding_box = Rect {
            /*
            x: position.x.into(),
            y: position.y.into(),
            */
            position: Point{x: position.x.into(), y: position.y.into()},
            width: element.width() as i16, 
            height: element.height() as i16,
        };
        Self {
            element,
            position,
            bounding_box,
        }
    }
```

```rust
// src/engine.rs

impl Image {
    ...
    pub fn set_x(&mut self, x: i16) {
        //self.bounding_box.x = x as i16;
        self.bounding_box.position.x = x as i16;
        self.position.x = x;
    }
    ...
```

```rust
// src/engine.rs

impl Renderer {
    pub fn clear(&self, rect: &Rect) {
        self.context.clear_rect(
            rect.x().into(),     // rect.x.into(),
            rect.y().into(),     // rect.y.into(),
            rect.width.into(),
            rect.height.into(),
        );
    }

```

```rust
// src/engine.rs

    pub fn draw_image(&self, 
                        image: &HtmlImageElement, 
                        frame: &Rect, 
                        destination: &Rect) {
        self.context
         .draw_image_with_html_image_element_and_sw_and_sh_and_dx_and_dy_and_dw_and_dh(
            &image,
            frame.x().into(),       // frame.x.into(),
            frame.y().into(),         // frame.y.into(),
            frame.width.into(),
            frame.height.into(),
            destination.x().into(),   //destination.x.into(),
            destination.y().into(),   //destination.y.into(),
            destination.width.into(),
            destination.height.into(),
        )
        .expect("Drawing is throwing exceptions! Unrecoverable error.");
    }//^-- draw_image
  
```

```rust
// src/engine.rs

...
    //for debuging
    pub fn draw_rect(&self, bounding_box: &Rect) {
        self.context.set_stroke_style(&JsValue::from_str("#FF0000"));
        self.context.begin_path();
        self.context.rect(
            bounding_box.x().into(),      // bounding_box.x.into(),
            bounding_box.y().into(),      // bounding_box.y.into(),
            bounding_box.width.into(),
            bounding_box.height.into(),
        );
        self.context.stroke();
    }
